  <h3>Signs of Fin Rot</h3>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Ragged, torn edges on the fish’s fins.</li>
      <li>Discoloration on the fish’s body and/or fins, such as red, white, black, or brown spots.</li>
      <li>Inflammation at the bases of the tail and fins.</li>
      <li>Lethargy and lack of movement through the tank.</li>
      <li>Loss of appetite.</li>

  <h3>Treating Fin Rot</h3>
  
    <ol>
      <li><b>Identify the cause of the fin rot and remove it from the environment.</b> This can include separating aggressive fish, removing hazardous decorations, and/or adjusting the water quality to ideal parameters.
</li>
      <li><b>Clean the aquarium.</b> Eliminating harmful bacteria and waste is <i>essential</i> for the recovery process. Additionally, many medications require the removal of filter cartridges and no water changes. Here is a more detailed guide on how to thoroughly clean your aquarium: <a href="https://www.aquariumcoop.com/blogs/aquarium/aquarium-cleaning">Aquarium Cleaning</a></li>
      <li><b>Treat the fin rot with specialized medications.</b> If water changes and improved environment aren't enough to cure the fin rot, or depending on the severity of the fin rot and presence of other infections, there are different medications to consider. If there is an aquatic veterinarian or aquatic pet shop in your area, it would be beneficial to consult them directly as to which medication will best fit your needs. Make sure you provide ample pictures of the affected fish and a water sample, in case they want to test the water to identify any lingering issues.Some common medicines are <b>erythromycin and MelaFix.</b></li>
      <li>Monitor your fish’s recovery and adjust treatment as needed. </li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Fin Rot Prevention</h3>
    <p>To prevent fin rot and keep it from recurring, there are several measures you can take. Perform regular water changes and tank cleanings to keep the aquarium environment safe for your fish. Keeping a well-conditioned and clean tank is the <i>best way</i> to prevent any infections in your fish. 
    </p>
    <p>In addition to regular cleanings, do not overfeed your fish. Excess waste is an easy way for harmful bacteria to grow in your tank, which will make the water quality poor and unsafe for your fish.
    </p>
    <p>Lastly, do not overcrowd your tank with too many fish or other aquatic critters, and keep an eye out for any fighting amongst them. Be sure to research the best tank mates for your fish, as some species will not live safely with others. There are many resources, <a href="https://pethelpful.com/fish-aquariums/How-to-get-the-community-right-in-your-community-aquarium">such as this website</a>, that can help you choose the best tank mates for your aquarium. </p>
    <p>Fin rot is one of the most common infections that can trouble your fish, but it is also one of the most preventable. With proper care, fin rot is easily avoidable.</p>
