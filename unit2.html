      <p>For online TTRPGs, such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the use of a character token is essential for combat maps, like those created in games on <a href="https://roll20.net/welcome">Roll20.</a> They help you see where exactly you are in relation to everything and everyone else, therefore allowing you to plan your actions accordingly. Many abilities are location and/or distance based, so knowing the distance from yourself to other people or objects is necessary.</p>
      <p>There are different ways you can make a token. While most players opt for the simple picture and circular border, such as those created by using <a href="https://rolladvantage.com/tokenstamp/">Token Stamp 2</a>, others choose the more unique, albeit time-consuming, route of fully customized tokens.</p>
      <p>I make my own tokens (<a href="page1.html">some examples here</a>), as well as tokens for all of my party members (the other players in the group) using various digital drawing and editing apps, such as <a href="https://ibispaint.com/?lang=en-US">Ibis Paint</a> and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/landpa.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw6_CYBhDjARIsABnuSzrD-D5Jc4yCMjhFv-QwgNCINisn07TXlgZkDMHt4su3Rj--C7dnkIkaAvIiEALw_wcB&sdid=KKQIN&mv=search&kw=photoshop&ef_id=Cj0KCQjw6_CYBhDjARIsABnuSzrD-D5Jc4yCMjhFv-QwgNCINisn07TXlgZkDMHt4su3Rj--C7dnkIkaAvIiEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!522504775617!e!!g!!photoshop!1712238394!67643541820">Photoshop</a>.

        <h2>What You Need to Make a Token</h2>
      </header>
      
      <p>To make a customized character token, there are a few things you will need to begin. Once you have these essential pieces, you can create the desired token to the best of your abilities.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A drawing or photo editing program, such as those listed earlier in this page.</li>
        <li>An image of your character that:</li>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Fits your character's appearance as closely as possible, if you can not commission custom artwork of your character.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>If this is your first character, a character for a one-shot or short campaign, or simply a character you aren't completely in love with, I would advise against commissioning artwork to start off with. I find that commissioning artwork of a character you have time to bond with makes the piece more memorable and thought-out.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Has a medium-to-high quality resolution (the higher, the better).</li>
            <li>Is free to use, or you have the artist's permission to use.</li>
            <aside>Note that if you intend to use the token for personal use <u>only</u>, you can forgo requirement "c" since the token will not be in commercial use or display.</aside>
          </ol>
        <li>A description, vibe, aesthetic, and/or mood-board of the character's race, class, backround, and personality.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A mood board for a druid character could be something like <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/305470787248505182/?nic_v3=1a1tFER6j">this</a>.</li>
            <li><article>If you're unsure how to create a unique and interesting character, this website gives great key points to follow while developing your character: <a href="https://slyflourish.com/building_great_dnd_characters.html">Building a Great D&amp;D Character</a>.</article></li>
          </ul>
        <li>A border based on the previous point's content (vibe, personality, etc.).</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I've compiled some token borders I've used in the past <a href="page2.html">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Borders can be combinations of different elements, examples of which I included in the link above &uarr;.</li>

        <h2>How to Create the Token</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Creating the token isn't a process that is easily learned from just reading- practice truly is the most important thing you can do. I've been making tokens for a year and a half now, and I'm still learning new things with each one that I make.</p>
      <p>To start off with, I recommend making simple tokens to get a feel for the layout of them and the general process. As you grow comfortable, branch out into more difficult designs to challenge yourself and learn new skills and techniques. Before you know it, you'll be crafting beautiful and unique tokens for you and others to use in online games!</p>
      <p><a href="page3.html">This web page</a> is a collection of timelapse videos of tokens I have made, in order from simplest to most complex. I have included commentary on my process for each token to explain what I am doing and why. With this, you can see how specific elements of the token are made by someone who has experience with doing so and thus pick up techniques that might otherwise take a considerable amount of time to figure out on your own.</p>
